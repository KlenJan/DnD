# Foundry VTT D&D 5e
paladin dnd macros with some animations and sound effects - customized for me, so you need to replace stuff you're not gonna use

replace sounds files with your own or just comment out the lines that use them as well as animations

List of abilities:
 - Lay On Hands
 - Divine Sense
 - Knowledge From Past Life (Reborn trait)
 - generic attack scripts

# How to create and edit macros

You can drag whatever ability to your action bar and then right click it to edit
