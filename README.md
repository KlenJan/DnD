# Foundry VTT D&D 5e
paladin dnd macros with some animations and sound effects - customized for me, so you need to replace stuff you're not gonna use

for animations you need fxmaster, automated animation and tokenmagicfx, most animations are done through interface, only lay on hands uses fxmaster

replace sounds files with your own
