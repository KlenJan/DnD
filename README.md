# Foundry VTT D&D 5e
paladin dnd macros with some animations and sound effects - customized for me, so you need to replace stuff you're not gonna use

for animations you need fxmaster, automated animation and tokenmagicfx, most animations are done through interface, only lay on hands uses fxmaster

replace sounds files with your own

List of abilities:
 - Lay On Hands
 - Divine Sense
 - Knowledge From Past Life (Reborn trait)
 - generic attack scripts

# How to create and edit macros

You can drag whatever ability to your action bar and then right click it to edit
