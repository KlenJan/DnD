# Foundry VTT D&D 5e
paladin dnd macros with some animations and sound effects - customized for me, so you need to replace stuff you're not gonna use (for example divine sense just checks for visibility, because I am playing reborn that has darkvision, if you can't see as far as 60ft you need to refactor the code a bit)

replace sounds files with your own or just comment out the lines that use them as well as animations

List of abilities:
 - Lay On Hands
 - Divine Sense
 - Knowledge From Past Life (Reborn trait)
 - generic attack scripts

# How to create and edit macros

You can drag whatever ability to your action bar and then right click it to edit
