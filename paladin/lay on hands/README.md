In order to properly use Lay On Hands, DM has to have loh_remove_gm.js macro

He has to have the macro placed on his bars and enable 'Execute as a GM' (the furnace module)

This is due to permission limitations, since you as a player can't remove conditions from other tokens

there, we will call a macro that gm has, and it will be executed with elevated privileges from their side
MACRO NAME MUST BE loh_remove_gm     <=== This will be called in the main lay on hands macro
